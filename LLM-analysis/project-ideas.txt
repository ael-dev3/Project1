SpacetimeDB project ideas
=========================

1) Real-time multiplayer game backends
- Top-down arena (agar.io style), co-op dungeon, or battle arena.
- Emphasis: entity state in tables, reducers for actions, subscriptions for client state.

2) Collaborative apps
- Shared whiteboard, kanban board, or live document comments.
- Emphasis: subscriptions for live UI updates and audit history.

3) Live ops dashboards
- Real-time admin/ops UI for game state, server metrics, or moderation tools.
- Emphasis: read-only subscriptions + reducer-based admin actions.

4) Chat and presence systems
- Global chat, guild chat, direct messages, online presence.
- Emphasis: reducers for send/rename, subscriptions for message streams.

5) Turn-based strategy
- Synchronized turns with reducers enforcing rules and transactions.
- Emphasis: deterministic game logic in reducers.

6) Real-time marketplace
- Player-to-player trading, live auctions, or inventory exchanges.
- Emphasis: constraints, indexes, and reducer validation.

7) Social simulation / MMO-lite
- Persistent world state, user-owned assets, crafting, and progression.
- Emphasis: in-memory speed + WAL persistence.

8) IoT or telemetry dashboards
- Stream sensor updates, alerting, and live charts.
- Emphasis: subscriptions for deltas, SQL for filtering.

9) Learning/prototyping tools
- Schema playground, reducer sandbox, or client SDK comparison demo.
- Emphasis: show Rust/C#/TypeScript parity with the same module.

10) Event-driven workflows
- Task queues, automated triggers, and scheduled reducers.
- Emphasis: scheduled tables + reducers for periodic jobs.

Notes
- Prefer a small prototype first: 1 table, 1 reducer, 1 subscription.
- Add auth with Identity/Token when moving beyond local testing.
