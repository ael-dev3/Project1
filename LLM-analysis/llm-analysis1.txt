Project1 LLM analysis
======================

Purpose
- README.md: project is to build a prototype for SpacetimeDB as a study/practice exercise.
- Repo currently holds study material copied from clockworklabs/spacetime-docs in study/.

High-level structure
- README.md: project purpose.
- study/: full SpacetimeDB documentation tree (markdown, nav, scripts, configs, assets).
- LLM-analysis/: analysis outputs (this file).

Key documentation coverage (study/docs)
- index.md: SpacetimeDB overview, state mirroring, tables, reducers, identities, FAQ.
- getting-started.md: install CLI, run spacetime start, login flow, quickstart links.
- deploying/maincloud.md: publish to Maincloud and connect via maincloud URL.
- deploying/spacetimedb-standalone.md: self-hosting guide with systemd, nginx, TLS, firewall, updates, troubleshooting.
- cli-reference.md: generated spacetime CLI reference (publish, delete, logs, call, describe, sql, server subcommands, etc).
- cli-reference/standalone-config.md: config.toml options (certificate-authority, logs, websocket).
- modules/index.md: server module overview and language links.
- modules/rust/quickstart.md: Rust chat module walkthrough (tables, reducers, lifecycle reducers).
- modules/rust/index.md: link to docs.rs SDK reference.
- modules/c-sharp/quickstart.md: C# chat module walkthrough.
- modules/c-sharp/index.md: C# module library reference (tables, reducers, types, scheduling, logging, identities, timestamps).
- sdks/index.md: client SDK overview and features.
- sdks/rust/quickstart.md: Rust CLI chat client tutorial.
- sdks/rust/index.md: Rust client SDK reference (DbConnection, callbacks, cache, reducers).
- sdks/c-sharp/quickstart.md: C# client chat tutorial with processing thread and input loop.
- sdks/c-sharp/index.md: C# client SDK reference (connection, subscriptions, events, cache).
- sdks/typescript/quickstart.md: React/Vite chat client tutorial with hooks and reducers.
- sdks/typescript/index.md: TypeScript client SDK reference.
- sql/index.md: SQL subsets for subscriptions and ad hoc queries, grammar, best practices.
- subscriptions/index.md: SubscriptionBuilder/SubscriptionHandle and best practices.
- subscriptions/semantics.md: subscription ordering and cache guarantees (note: file states it was generated from a Discord discussion and edited).
- rls/index.md: row level security filters with :sender, limitations, recursion rules.
- http/authorization.md: OIDC token usage and Authorization header, GET /v1/ping.
- http/identity.md: identity and token endpoints, verification, and public key.
- http/database.md: database publish/update/delete, schema, logs, sql, and subscribe endpoints.
- webassembly-abi/index.md: low-level module ABI (logging, buffers, scheduling, table ops).
- bsatn.md: BSATN binary encoding reference for algebraic values.
- sats-json.md: SATS JSON format for algebraic types and values.
- appendix.md: auto_inc sequence behavior and caveats.
- unity/index.md + part-1..part-4.md: Unity tutorial for Blackholio (server module, bindings, client, gameplay, movement/collision).

Study material meta
- study/README.md: migration notice, editing workflow, nav.js generation, CLI reference generation, link check, license.
- study/STYLE.md: documentation style guide (audience, code formatting, limitations, tutorial style).
- study/llms.md: large consolidated overview and quickstart-style guidance, includes identity derivation and subscription semantics.
- study/LICENSE.txt: Apache 2.0 license for docs.

BSATN spec files (study/bsatn)
- spec.tex: LaTeX spec for BSATN encoding definitions.
- readme.md: spec notes and build instructions (katex, wkhtmltopdf).
- Makefile: build spec.html/spec.pdf using katex and wkhtmltopdf.
- katex-header.html: KaTeX CSS header snippet.
- .gitignore: ignores spec.html/spec.pdf.
- LICENSE: empty file.

Build and tooling
- study/package.json: docs tooling deps (github-slugger, unified, remark-parse, tsx, typescript).
- study/tsconfig.json: compiles nav.ts to docs/nav.js.
- study/scripts/checkLinks.ts: validates internal links and images against nav and headings.
- study/scripts/checkNav.mjs: compares nav listing to docs files (expects docs/nav.mjs).
- study/nav.ts: nav definition for docs.
- study/docs/nav.js: compiled nav output.
- study/.prettierrc: formatting rules.
- study/.gitignore: editor and node artifacts.
- study/yarn.lock: Yarn v1 lockfile with Node dependencies (esbuild and others).
- study/.github/workflows/repo-migration-notice.yml: auto-comment and close issues/PRs to redirect to SpacetimeDB repo.

Assets (study/docs/unity)
- part-1-hero-image.png
- part-1-unity-hub-new-project.jpg
- part-1-universal-2d-template.png
- part-3-player-on-screen.png
Note: binary assets not inspected beyond filenames.

Notable quirks
- checkNav.mjs expects docs/nav.mjs but the repo has docs/nav.js (may need rename or script update).
- bsatn/LICENSE is empty.

Summary
- This repository is a learning workspace for SpacetimeDB.
- Current contents are almost entirely documentation and study material from the official docs repo.
- No prototype module or client code exists yet; the next step is to add actual project code as needed.
